 - add CPAN::Changes tests.
 - remove portability tests.

1.12044806 2010-11-06T18:20:55Z
 - A little bit more testing of the codebase, tests should be now comprehensive enough to detect most change-bugs.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.12044803, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - test: +1

1.12044803 2010-11-06T15:26:58Z

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.12044518, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: +2
 - runtime: (suggests: +1)
 - test: (suggests: +1)

1.12044518 2010-11-04T06:32:54Z
 - Spliced Test deps into its own module.
 - Shipped work behind _try_regen_metadata to Dist::Zilla::Util::EmulatePhase
 - meta_noindex is now *ON* by default. This behavioural change is reason for Bumping the minor to 12. Rationale: If
   you're using MetaNoIndex and this module, then you want things to get skipped. With provides =>, cpan won't do any
   indexing itself, so no_index in the data does nothing. So, this module brings that power back to life by
   implementing it manually.
 - Add thanks while I remember.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.11044405, see misc/*.deps* for details

 - test: -3

1.11044404 2010-11-02T16:25:56Z
 - Upgrade to recent @KENTNL changes ( remove inc/ and xt/ from source tree, relocate perlcritic.rc )
 - Now have a convenience function, usable by all consuming roles that permit filtering packages that match criteira
   added to MetaNoIndex. Once your role uses this function, the attribute also bolted on by this change ( meta_noindex
   = 1 ) will control this behaviour. Thanks to xdg/David Golden for this suggestion.

1.10001919 2009-09-12T06:17:57Z
