Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides

This Distribution Contains a small bundle of plugins for various ways of
populating the "META.yml" that is built with your distribution.

The initial reason for this is due to stuff that uses MooseX::Declare
style class definitions not being parseable by many tools upstream, so
this is here to cover this problem by defining it in the metadata.
